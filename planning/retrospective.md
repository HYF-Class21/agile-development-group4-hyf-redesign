# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

-

## Continue Doing

-Trying new thing with css , like adding and removing statements [easily done
with the browser]. -Reading about html structure and nesting objects. -Working
on the sites html and css files for things that can be improved and/or bugs.
-Update the development strategy even if theres small changes to the code.

## Start Doing

-Using devtools in my favorite sites to understand how they are built. Also to
take inspiration from them and create my own objects.

## Lessons Learned

-Even with devtools analyzing objects and statements take long time, so before
coding is better to really get what you want to build.

-Working with few divisions per section proved to be easier to work but less
customizable than having one for every object planed.

## Strategy vs. Board

-Pretty much the html file worked because it was kept simple and every section
had a similar structure.

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Styling wasn't that smooth, had to make many changes while trying to
  understand flexboxes.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Some styling statements were confusing to add because they are subtle enough
  to be missed for an untrained eye :sad:.

- When working with media querries it's somewhat difficult to understand how
  resizing of different elements works while at the same time trying to maintain
  the proportions of those elements the same.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- After starting to write HTML and CSS some of us had to make changes to our
  structure and styling because it did not turn out like the original look of
  the website, and therefore had to change our dev. strat.

### Or remove extra steps?
