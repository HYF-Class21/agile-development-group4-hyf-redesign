# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

-

## Continue Doing

-Trying new thing with css , like adding and removing statements [easily done
with the browser]. -Reading about html structure and nesting objects. -Working
on the sites html and css files for things that can be improved and/or bugs.
-Update the development strategy even if theres small changes to the code.

## Start Doing

-Using devtools in my favorite sites to understand how they are built. Also to
take inspiration from them and create my own objects.

## Lessons Learned

-Even with devtools analyzing objects and statements take long time, so before
coding is better to really get what you want to build.

-Working with few divisions per section proved to be easier to work but less
customizable than having one for every object planed.

## Strategy vs. Board

-Pretty much the html file worked because it was kept simple and every section
had a similar structure.

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Styling wasn't that smooth, had to make many changes while trying to
  understand flexboxes.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Some styling statements were confusing to add because they are subtle enough
  to be missed for an untrained eye :sad:.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

### Or remove extra steps?
